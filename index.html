    <h3>About</h3>
    <div class ="row">
        <div class="column">
            <p>Battleship is a guessing game for two players.  It is played on ruled grids concealed from the other player.  To better help you in this game of strategy and guesswork, both boards will be provided for you to keep track of shots fired, though it will not show you where the enemy ships are located.</p>
            <p>The rules of the game have been provided to you, in case any sort of refresher was needed.  Your ships can be placed horizontally or vertically, but they cannot be placed diagonally.</p>
            <p>Click on the link <a href="gameboard.html">here</a> to begin setting up the board and start playing!</p>
