# Battleship Online
<h2>About</h2>
<p>CURRENT VERSION: 02</p>
<p>This project is for Computer Science 2550 (CS 2550) at Utah Valley University.  Throughout the semester it will change and grow to contain a fully functional and interactive rendition of a battleship "board" game. It is worth a significant portion of my grade, so it needs to look good and be efficient, but most importantly, WORK!</p>
<h2>TODO</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Add more information to index.html</li>
    <li>Add interactive elements to gameboard.html</li>
    <li>Work on AI</li>
    <li>Work on basic game logic</li>
</ul>
